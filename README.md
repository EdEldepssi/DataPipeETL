# ETL Process Overview

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process implemented for the provided system. It includes details on code structure, testing procedures, coding standards, dependency management, and performance optimization.

## ETL Components

### Xetra ETL Component
- **Purpose**: Extracts financial data from the Xetra system, transforms it according to specified requirements, and loads it into a target system for analysis.
- **Functionality**: Includes handling different file types, ensuring data quality, and managing connections to data sources and sinks.

### Error Handling
- **Custom Exceptions**: Defined to handle various error conditions that might arise during the ETL process, ensuring graceful failure and easy debugging.

### S3 Bucket Connectors
- **Functionality**: Manages interactions with AWS S3 buckets, including file uploads, downloads, and listing contents.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Framework**: Python's unittest and pytest.
- **Coverage**: Aims for high (ideally 100%) test coverage.
- **Mocks & Stubs**: Utilizes mocks for external services and stubs for database interactions.

### Integration Testing
- **Framework**: Python's unittest.
- **Real Interfaces**: Tests how different modules interact with each other and with real interfaces like AWS S3.

### Test Specification
- **File**: `Test_Specification.xlsx`
- **Contents**: Detailed test cases, expected outcomes, and criteria for ETL process testing.

## Coding Standards

### Linters
- **Tools**: Pylint, MyPy.
- **Purpose**: Ensures code quality, identifies bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.

## Dependency Management

### Strategies
- **requirements.txt**: Used for specifying complete environments with pinned versions for reproducibility.
- **Pipenv**: Utilized for managing virtual environments and package dependencies, aiming for deterministic builds and minimized responsibility for sub-dependency updates.

## Performance Optimization

### Profiling Tools
- **cProfile & profile**: Standard libraries for collecting statistics about frequency and duration of function calls.
- **line-profiler & memory-profiler**: Third-party tools for detailed line-by-line profiling and memory usage analysis.
- **timeit**: Used for measuring the execution time of small code snippets, helping identify performance bottlenecks.

## Configuration Files
- **xetra-secrets.yml**: Contains sensitive information and credentials.(not included in the repository for security).
- **xetra-config.yml, cronwf-xetra-dag.yml**: Define configurations for the ETL process and scheduling details.
